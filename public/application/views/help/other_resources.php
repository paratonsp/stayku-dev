		<h2>How To Remove Page Info From Printed Pages</h2>
		
		
		<p> By default browsers will add the date, page number and URL to any page printed from the Internet. For most (if not all) of the printables on this site, you probably don't want text at the top and bottom of the page. Luckily it's pretty easy to fix, just pick your browser and follow the instructions below.</p>

		<p>Since all printers act slightly differently, these tips may not work for you. If you find better ways, please <a href="/feedback/">contact me</a> and let me know what works best for you. (Please include which browser, OS, printer type and any other information that you think may be helpful).</p>

		<p>These are just here as a guide, I give no guarantees that it will work on all Operating Systems or printers, but they are working for me. Oh, and yes, your computer will probably look a bit different (especially in the Windows screenshots), but the main idea is the same.</p>

		<h2 id="ie7">Internet Explorer 7</h2>
		<p>They've moved everything around for this release. By default there's a small image of a printer, click that and go to "Page Setup...". Below is a screenshot showing the button you're looking for. From there it's the same steps as for IE6 (the instructions are in the next section below).</p>

		<h2 id="ie6">Internet Explorer 6</h2>
		<p>Go to "File", "Page Setup...", then erase the text in the "Headers and Footers text boxes.<br> (The default for header is &amp;w&amp;bPage &amp;p of &amp;P and for footer &amp;u&amp;b&amp;d if you need to put it back later. IE's default margins are 0.75 inches.)</p>

		<div class="center"><img src="<?php echo base_url()."images/help/ie-header.png"; ?>" width="400" height="420" alt="IE Print Page Setup Screen"></div>

		<p>Click the "OK" button and you're done.</p>



		<h2 id="winfox">Firefox</h2>
		<p>From the menu in the top left corner of your browser, choose "File", then "Page setup..". Go to the second tab called "Margins &amp; Header / Footer", in the drop down lists choose "Blank" for all the items you don't want printed. The screenshot below gives a better view of what I mean.</p>

		<div class="center"><img src="<?php echo base_url()."images/help/firefox-header.png"; ?>" width="394" height="472" alt="Firefox print options setup tab"></div>


		<p> If you want, you can also adjust the print margins here as well, Firefox's default margins are set at 0.5 inches. Once you have your setting chosen, click "OK", and you're done!</p>
		<p>If you'd like a faster way to get to the print preview feature from within Firefox, the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1778/">Print / Print Preview</a> extensions is very handy. It adds a submenu to your context menu (the menu that pops up when you right click on a webpage) with "Print", "Print Preview" and "Page Setup". Much faster if you change margins, headers etc. often.</p>


		<h2 id="opera">Opera</h2>
		<p>Pretty much the same as for Firefox. Go to "File" (top left corner of your browser), then choose "Print Options...". Now uncheck the "Print headers and footers" checkbox, click OK.</p>

		<div class="center"><img src="<?php echo base_url()."images/help/opera-headers.png"; ?>" width="320" height="353" alt="Opera Print Options Screen"></div>



		<h2 id="chrome">Google's Chrome</h2>
		<p>Sorry guys, it looks like you're out of luck with Chrome, since it doesn't let you delete (or modify) the headers. Maybe in a future update. For now I'd suggest using a different browser if you want to print a page without them.</p>
		<p><strong>Mac Chrome Notes:</strong><br></p>
		<p>Interestingly it never prints header or footer info on a Mac (even when we'd want them) as far as I can see.<p>
